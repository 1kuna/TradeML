# TradeML ‚Äî Autonomous Equities + Options Trading Agent

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Phase%201%20Complete%20(~75%25)-green)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

**Mission:** Build an autonomous research & trading system that learns cross-sectional stock edges and options volatility/term-structure edges from free-tier data, simulates and trades with realistic costs, and self-improves within strict anti-overfitting governance.

**Non-goals (v1):** broker integration, taxable lots accounting, portfolio margin optimization, HFT/latency arbitrage.

## üìå Current Status

- Phase 1 complete (~75%). See `PROGRESS.md` for the full completion report, validation results (CPCV/PBO/DSR), and next steps for Phase 2.


## üéØ Go/No-Go Criteria (all OOS, net of costs/impact)

- **Equities sleeve:** Sharpe ‚â• 1.0; Max Drawdown ‚â§ 20%; Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) > 0; Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO) ‚â§ 5%
- **Options sleeve:** Same bars on delta-hedged PnL (vol sleeve) and total PnL (spread sleeve); net Vega exposure bounded by policy

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
/repo
  /infra              # Docker-compose, Terraform (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Redis, MLflow)
  /data_layer         # Raw/curated/reference data (Parquet, partitioned by date/symbol)
  /feature_store      # Equities & options features (PIT-safe, lag-enforced)
  /labeling           # Horizon returns, triple-barrier labels
  /validation         # CPCV, PBO, DSR (anti-overfitting governance)
  /models             # Baselines (Ridge/LightGBM) ‚Üí challengers
  /portfolio          # Vol targeting, fractional Kelly, constraints
  /execution          # Cost models, Almgren-Chriss, Avellaneda-Stoikov
  /backtest           # Event-driven, position-aware, deterministic engine
  /ops                # Monitoring, drift, tripwires, champion-challenger
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Git & DVC** (optional, for data versioning)

### 2. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> TradeML
cd TradeML

# Copy environment template and fill in API keys
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (see API Keys section below)

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start Infrastructure

```bash
cd infra
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps

# Services will be available at:
# - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
# - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)
# - MLflow UI: http://localhost:5000
# - Redis: localhost:6379
```

### 4. API Keys Required (Free Tier)

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:

| Service | URL | Free Tier | Purpose |
|---------|-----|-----------|---------|
| **IEX Cloud** | https://iexcloud.io/ | 50k messages/month | Tick data (single venue) |
| **Alpaca Markets** | https://alpaca.markets/ | Unlimited paper trading | Minute/EOD bars, live stream |
| **Alpha Vantage** | https://www.alphavantage.co/ | 25 requests/day | Corporate actions, delistings |
| **FRED** | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/ | Unlimited (rate-limited) | Risk-free rates, macro data |
| **Finnhub** | https://finnhub.io/ | 60 calls/min | Options chains, IV, Greeks |
| **FMP (optional)** | https://financialmodelingprep.com/ | 250 requests/day | Alternative delisting data |

### 5. Initialize Database

Database schema is automatically initialized via `infra/init-db/01-init-schema.sql` when PostgreSQL container starts.

To manually run migrations:
```bash
docker exec -i trademl_postgres psql -U trademl -d trademl < infra/init-db/01-init-schema.sql
```

---

## üìä Data Pipeline

### Storage Layout

All data stored in MinIO (S3-compatible) as Parquet, partitioned by `date/symbol`:

```
/raw              # Immutable vendor payloads with checksums
  /equities_bars
  /equities_ticks
  /options_nbbo
  /macros_fred
/curated          # Cleaned, corporate-action adjusted, PIT-safe
  /equities_ohlcv_adj
  /options_iv
/reference        # Calendars, delistings, corporate actions, tick sizes
```

### Running Data Ingestion

```python
# Example: Ingest Alpaca EOD bars for last 2 years
python -m data_layer.connectors.alpaca_connector \
  --start-date 2022-01-01 \
  --end-date 2024-01-01 \
  --symbols SPY,AAPL,MSFT \
  --timeframe 1Day
```

## üß™ Phase 1: Data & Skeleton (Weeks 1-3)

**Status:** üü° In Progress

- [x] Infrastructure (Docker-compose, PostgreSQL, MinIO, MLflow)
- [x] Directory structure
- [ ] Exchange calendars with DST/half-day handling
- [ ] Data connectors (IEX, Alpaca, Alpha Vantage, FRED, Finnhub)
- [ ] Corporate actions pipeline (PIT-safe adjustments)
- [ ] Delistings database (survivorship bias elimination)
- [ ] Minimal backtester (daily, fee+spread costs)

---

## üìà Phase 2: Baselines & Validation (Weeks 3-6)

**Status:** ‚ö™ Pending

- [ ] Equity features (momentum, vol, liquidity, seasonality)
- [ ] Labeling (5/20-day horizon returns, triple-barrier)
- [ ] **CPCV with purging & embargo** (8 folds, 10-day embargo)
- [ ] **PBO & DSR calculators** (anti-overfitting governance)
- [ ] Baseline models: Ridge/Logistic vs LightGBM
- [ ] Portfolio construction (vol targeting, fractional Kelly)
- [ ] Execution simulator (Almgren-Chriss, square-root impact)

**Target:** Beat naive momentum/value baselines **net of all costs** or reject with documented reasons.

---

## üé≤ Phase 3: Options Foundations (Weeks 6-9)

**Status:** ‚ö™ Pending

- [ ] Options NBBO ‚Üí IV computation (Black-Scholes)
- [ ] SVI/SSVI surface fitting with no-arbitrage checks
- [ ] Options features (IV level/slope/skew, term structure, VRP)
- [ ] Options labeling (vol sleeve: ŒîIV, VRP; directional sleeve: underlier + surface)
- [ ] Options models (LightGBM for IV forecasts)
- [ ] Delta-hedged PnL framework with daily re-hedging

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 4: Operations & Governance (Weeks 9-12)

**Status:** ‚ö™ Pending

- [ ] MLflow model registry
- [ ] Champion-challenger framework
- [ ] Shadow trading (‚â•4 weeks before promotion)
- [ ] Drift monitoring (PSI/KL on features, forecast calibration)
- [ ] Tripwires (DD thresholds, slippage vs model)
- [ ] Daily production runbook automation
- [ ] Reporting APIs (trade blotter, scorecard)

---

## üìê Non-Negotiable Guardrails

1. **No model promotion without CPCV + PBO + DSR** and multi-week shadow trading beating champion net
2. **Data lineage on every row:** `ingested_at`, `source_uri`, `transform_id`
3. **Capacity realism:** square-root impact estimates, participation caps (‚â§10% ADV)
4. **Universe realism:** delisted names included; splits/dividends applied by our logic
5. **Shorting realism:** borrow fees/HTB indicators; haircut short alpha if unknown

## üî¨ Testing Strategy

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit -v

# Run integration tests (requires Docker services)
pytest tests/integration -v

# Run acceptance tests (backtest parity checks)
pytest tests/acceptance -v

# Code quality
black .
ruff check .
