# Legacy Modeling Stack

This directory houses the pre-carve-out modeling code and scripts. All new
model development lives under the top-level `models/`, `ops/pipelines/`, and
`execution/` packages. Use this folder for reference onlyâ€”new commits should not
modify the contents once the burn-in period is complete.
